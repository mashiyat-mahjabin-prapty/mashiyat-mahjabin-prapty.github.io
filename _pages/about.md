I'm Mashiyat Mahjabin Prapty, a researcher passionate about blending Computational Biology with Computer Science. I finished my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering in July 2024, and now I’m working as a Research Intern at the National University of Singapore with Professor Dr. Yang Zhang.

My research revolves around using machine learning and deep learning to solve biological problems. I’ve worked with a variety of datasets, from protein sequences to brain data, and even explored Computer Vision. Though I come from a tech background, it's the complexities of the human body that truly fascinate me. I'm drawn to using computational tools to contribute to areas like drug discovery and cancer research—fields where real-world impact is possible.

Looking ahead, I’m planning to start a PhD in Computational Biology in Fall 2025. Outside of research, I love reading (romance novels, mostly!) and traveling, which keeps me grounded and curious.
