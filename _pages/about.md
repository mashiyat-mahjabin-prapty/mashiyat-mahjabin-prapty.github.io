I’m Mashiyat Mahjabin Prapty, a dedicated researcher with a deep passion for Computational Biology and Computer Science. In July 2024, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and I’m currently working as a Research Intern at the National University of Singapore under the mentorship of Professor Dr. Yang Zhang.

My research focuses on leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to tackle complex biological challenges. I’ve had the opportunity to work with a variety of datasets, including proteins, microarrays, heart sounds, and brain data. Along the way, I also delved into the world of Computer Vision, which I found both fascinating and enriching.

While my academic background is rooted in Computer Science, it’s the animate world—especially the human body and its intricate complexities—that truly captivates me. From an early age, I’ve been driven by a desire to make a meaningful difference in the world. Computational Biology, with its potential to revolutionize fields like drug discovery and cancer biomarker identification, feels like the perfect avenue for me to apply my computational skills toward a greater cause. I’m deeply motivated by the idea of contributing to how we understand and treat diseases, and I’m committed to making a lasting impact in this field.

Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a PhD in Computational Biology, starting in the Fall of 2025.

Beyond my research, I’m an avid reader—especially of romance novels—and I love traveling to explore new places. These hobbies help me stay balanced and inspired in both my personal and professional life.
