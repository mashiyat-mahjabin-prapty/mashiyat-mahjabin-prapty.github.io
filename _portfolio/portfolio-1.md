Models used: YOLOv6, YOLOv8, Co-DETR, RTDETR  
- Designed a pipeline for detecting vehicles in the context of Bangladesh with the BadODD dataset
that captures more than 5000 images in 9 cities of this country.
- Explored various pretrained models such as YOLO variants and detection transformers. Finally, chose
RTDETR as the best model as it captures the hue of both YOLO models and DETRs
