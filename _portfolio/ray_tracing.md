**Language**: C++  
**Library**: OpenGL  
- Developed a ray tracing pipeline entirely from scratch, incorporating the Phong Lighting Model for accurate lighting effects and Recursive Reflection for realistic rendering.
- This pipeline enables the simulation of complex light interactions and creates visually stunning scenes with lifelike reflections and shading.
