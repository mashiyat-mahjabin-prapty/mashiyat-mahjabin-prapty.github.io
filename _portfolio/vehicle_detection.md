**Models used**: YOLOv6, YOLOv8, Co-DETR, RTDETR  

- Developed a pipeline for detecting vehicles in the context of Bangladesh using the **BadODD** dataset, which contains over 5,000 images captured across 9 cities in the country.
- Experimented with several pretrained models, including YOLO variants and detection transformers. **RTDETR** was selected as the most suitable model, as it effectively balances the strengths of both YOLO models and DETRs.
