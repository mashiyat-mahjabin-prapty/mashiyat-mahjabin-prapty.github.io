- In my recent work, I have undertaken a comprehensive gene expression analysis of microarray cancer
datasets, employing advanced techniques such as feature engineering and machine learning
ensembles.
- By integrating SHAP SHapley Additive exPlanations) and conducting enrichment analysis, I have
provided a robust framework for interpreting the results, contributing valuable insights into the
complex landscape of cancer genetics
