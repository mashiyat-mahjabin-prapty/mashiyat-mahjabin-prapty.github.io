- Even though live brains are widely studied in the literature, dead brains remain little explored as perhaps it is generally believed to have a dead brain not workable anymore.
- In contrary to such general perception, in this work, we explore the possibility of making a dead brain work again.
- Explored outputs from a dead brain in response to applying external stimuli (in the form of electrical signals) to it.
