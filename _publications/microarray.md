- In this work, I have undertaken a comprehensive gene expression analysis of microarray cancer datasets, employing advanced techniques such as feature engineering and machine learning ensembles.
- By integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and conducting enrichment analysis, I have provided a robust framework for interpreting the results, contributing valuable insights into the complex landscape of cancer genetics
